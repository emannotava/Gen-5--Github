pmXXXX_YY_ZZ_NNNN_GGGG

XXXX = National/Index ID of the pokemon in question.
	   #MUST be padded with 0's so the end number is 4 digits
	   
YY = Form number for any NON-REGIONAL form this is 00 if something has no forms,
	 but if it does have forms the first form number starts with 11 and counts up from there
	 #MUST be padded with 0's so the end number is 2 digits

ZZ = As of PLA/ScVi regional form numbers have been seperated from regular forms in terms of naming conventions.
	 Regional form numbers also come with specific numbers for specific regions:
	  - 11 = Alola
	  - 31 = Galar
	  - 41 = Hisui
	  - ?? = TODO: Add more regional form numbers here
	 #MUST be padded with 0's so the end number is 2 digits

NNNN = Form Name, not normally used in the official game's naming conventions, but it sure makes it easier for me
	   #Can be any reasonable length
	   
GGGG = Gender, most pokemon don't look any different but some mons look different based on their gender.
	   This can be a very minor texture edit or color change, but sometimes it can also have a unique model.
	   Gender Naming conventions are as follows:
	    - UNISEX = Same model and textures for both genders
	    - MALE = Male specific model and/or textures
	    - FEMALE = Female specific model and/or textures
		
Note that in the latest gen an additonal part was added to the naming conventions,
that's practically always at 0 except for cases like Minior, Alcremie and that one Gen 9 bird with a weird ass haircut
